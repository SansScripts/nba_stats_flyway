# NBA Stats Flyway Database

## Overview

This project serves as a demonstration of how to use Flyway for database migrations. Flyway is a powerful tool that makes it easy to manage changes to your database, allowing you to version control your SQL scripts in a straightforward manner. This example uses an NBA stats database to showcase the capabilities of Flyway.

## Features

- Version-controlled database migrations
- Easy rollback capabilities
- Demonstrates complex database operations like adding/removing columns, changing data types, etc.
- Sample data related to NBA statistics

## Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL
- Flyway CLI
- Git

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SansScripts/nba_stats_flyway.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    ```bash
    cd nba_stats_flyway
    ```

3. **Install Flyway**

    Follow the [official Flyway installation guide](https://flywaydb.org/getstarted/firststeps/commandline).

4. **Configure Flyway**

    Edit the `flyway.conf` file to include your database credentials.

    ```conf
    flyway.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database
    flyway.user=your_username
    flyway.password=your_password
    ```

5. **Run Migrations**

    ```bash
    flyway migrate
    ```

## Usage

Once the database is set up, you can perform various operations to understand the power and flexibility of Flyway.

- To migrate to the latest version:

    ```bash
    flyway migrate
    ```

- To rollback a version:

    ```bash
